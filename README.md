Python Pathfinder game allows you to place two nodes over the set graph and then add walls and water pathways to slow the pathfinder from finding nodes.

Requirements to play:
Have pygame installed 

Game controls:
Right click 1: Places start node

Right click 2: Places end node

Right click 3, 4, 5....: Places barriers

Hovering over node and pressing "w" allows tou to place water node. This is a weighted node of 2, which allows 
you to go through walls at a cost of 2 nodes. 

Reset: is "r" but it does not fully reset (game bug). Full reset is exiting the application
